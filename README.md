# 8-Puzzle Solver using A* Search Algorithm
This C++ program solves the 8-puzzle problem using the A* search algorithm. The 8-puzzle is a sliding puzzle that consists of a 3x3 grid with eight numbered tiles and one blank space. The goal is to rearrange the tiles from a given initial state to a specified goal state using the minimum number of moves.
## Notes
Ensure that both the initial and goal states are solvable. The program includes a solvability check based on the parity of inversions.

The program assumes valid input for the initial and goal states (a permutation of the numbers 0 to 8 for the 3x3 grid).
